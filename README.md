# Daily Inspiration 

Use [Daily Inspiration](https://imarijoyborda.com/inspiration-api/) to view random inspiring quote/message every hour. Each quote are also accompanied by a beatiful background. Use this to start your day inspired!

My motivation: Before starting work in the morning, I like to read inspiring quotes to get me hype up for the day. I find that doing so help me become more productive for the day. However, there is no minimalist and beautiful site that shows quotes on daily basis. Most sites look dull, uninspiring, and has uncessary other details. I develop this site to generate inspiring quotes beautifully and dynamically.

## How To Use
Simply visit the site to see the quote of the hour. The author/source of the quote is also shown. Quotes regenerate per day. The background changes every refresh. 

## How It's Made
This uses [Inspiration API](https://api.goprogram.ai/inspiration/docs/) and [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/). Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Add links for social media sharing (twitter, facebook, etc.)
* Allow saving of image/video.

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
